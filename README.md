## Project Outline

For this project I had to design three unique buttons animations using CSS transitions and animations.

## Design Choices:

Button 1:

For the first button I decided to label it 'Read More' and design it with a book theme, where the button looks like a book itself. I animated the button to reflect the motion of a book being taken off a shelf, sliding it to the side and adding a slight tilt. I have made the animation continous so that it attracts the user's attention, but subtle enough that it is not so overwhelming.

Button 2:

The second button is labelled 'Listen' to show that it connects to audio media. When it is hovered over it has a background image of a pulsing speaker and the button pulses as well to reflect the vibration of sound. 

Button 3:

 The last button has a background of moving shopping bags in the background with the label 'Purchase' in front. I chose a simpler animation for this design where when the button is hovered over it grows slowly in size as if the the moving shopping bags are being given to the user, reflecting a towards motion.

 Common Designs:

 Each button has a moving image in theme with its use, and each grow in size when hovered over. I kept the background colors of the last two buttons, when their not engaged with, a monochromatic beige color with no animaton so that when the user does interact with the buttons, the animations are an inviting suprise to draw their attention.

 ## Challenges:

 The challenges faced with this project was mainly animating the buttons in a way that reflected the motions I was trying to create: sliding book off a shelf, pulsing speaker, bags being brought towards user. Getting the exact angles the book needed to rotate and distance it had to slide, the rhythm of the pulse for the speaker in terms of speed and how broad it expands. The purchase button was not too difficult to figure out.

 ## Features I am proud of:

 The feature I am most proud of is the pulse of the speaker button. It was the second hardest animation to figure out but it came out nicely and is my favourite animation.
